# Some important links

## Week 00

1. [Virtual machine setup](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/)
Great walk through to configure Debian virtual machine for our Operating System course, including the VirtualBox basic settings, Debian installation walk through, installing some Debian packages (probably those that are gonna be used in this course), and also setting up GitHub public key and some basic git commands (i.e. 4 GIT mantras).

## Week 01
1. [Learn linux command and basic shell scripting](https://www.linuxcommand.org/)

This is a great website to start learning about linux commands from the very basic. It also shows you how to write shell scripts along with some examples. Those are two things that I learnt during this week and I am gonna revisit those later on. Moreover, this site also provides you with a free e-book named *The Linux Command Line* that can be downloaded [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxcommand/files/TLCL/19.01/TLCL-19.01.pdf/download) and some more advanced topics like dialog, AWK, etc.


2. [Linux BASH Shell Script Basics](https://youtu.be/6W8sAWakcxY)

A video that introduces you to basic linux bash shell script. It is actually part two of a video series (I didn't include part one because it is really basic). The part three of the video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/9aD59kA_P1M).


3. [Advanced Bash Scripting Guide](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/abs-guide.pdf)

An e-book that provides comprehensive guide to linux bash scripting. It is a learning in progress though and I am gonna refer this book over and over again.
