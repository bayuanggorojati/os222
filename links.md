# Some important links

## Week 00
[LinuxCommand.org](https://www.linuxcommand.org/)

This is a great website to start learning about linux commands from the very basic. It also shows you how to write shell scripts along with some examples. Those are two things that I learnt during this week and I am gonna revisit those later on. Moreover, this site also provides you with a free e-book named *The Linux Command Line* that can be downloaded [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxcommand/files/TLCL/19.01/TLCL-19.01.pdf/download) and some more advanced topics like dialog, AWK, etc.


[Linux BASH Shell Script Basics part 2](https://youtu.be/6W8sAWakcxY)

A video that introduces you to basic linux bash shell script. It is actually part two of a video series (I didn't include part one because it is really basic). The part three of the video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/9aD59kA_P1M).


[Advanced Bash Scripting Guide](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/abs-guide.pdf)

An e-book that provides comprehensive guide to linux bash scripting. It is a learning in progress though and I am gonna refer this book over and over again.
